Overview of Data Set : 
	The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. 
	Each person performed six activities  wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. 
	Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope,3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz were captured.
	The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). 
	The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. 
	The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. 


subject : Subject / Volunteer whose measurements are recorded in the data set. To maintain anonymity the values here are ID numbers
