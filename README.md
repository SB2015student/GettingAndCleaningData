# GettingAndCleaningData
This is the repository to collect the files for my submission to the coursera project 

### Objective
For the purpose of the course - 
	Download the complicated and unclean dataset generated by the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones
	Merge the Training and Test Datasets
	Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
	Apply descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
	Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names
	Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.



### Dataset Analysis 
1. Measurements are explained in the "features_info.txt" and the labels for the measurements can be found in "features.txt"
2. Activities in the dataset appear as 1:5 but associated labels are in "activity_labels.txt"
3. Data is distributed in two folders "test" and "train"
4. Each folder contains data in 3 files with un-descriptive names 
	* subject_test.txt --> contains the subject for measurements
	* Y_test.txt --> contains the activity information for measurements
	* X_test.txt --> contains the actual measurements

### Algorithm
	* Assumption : it will be easier to subset the data and merge after its tidy * 
	1. for TEST data 
		* Combine the subject, y (activity) and x (measurements) files into one data set
		* Translate the activity code to real activity names
		* Extract only the mean and std data - discard the others
		* Assign the descriptive labels to the data
	2. for TRAIN data
		* Combine the subject, y (activity) and x (measurements) files into one data set
		* Translate the activity code to real activity names
		* Extract only the mean and std data - discard the others
		* Assign the descriptive labels to the data
	3. Merge the TEST and TRAIN Datasets
	4. Summarize the data by each activity each subject
